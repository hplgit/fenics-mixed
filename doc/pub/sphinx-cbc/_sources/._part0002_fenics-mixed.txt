FEniCS solver with optimization in Octave
=========================================

While Python has gained significant momentum in scientific computing
in recent years, Matlab and its open source counterpart Octave are
still much more dominating tools in the community.  There are tons
of MATLAB/Octave code around that FEniCS users may like to take
advantage of. Fortunately,
MATLAB and Octave both have Python interfaces so it is straightforward
to call MATLAB/Octave from FEniCS simulators implemented in Python.
The technical details of such coupling is the presented with the
aid of an example.

Basic use of Pytave
-------------------

First we show how to operate Octave from Python.
Our focus is on the Octave interface named `Pytave <http://launchpad.net/pytave>`_.
The basic Pytave command is


.. code-block:: python

        result = pytave.feval(n, "func", A, B, ...)

for running the function ``func`` in the Octave engine with arguments
``A``, ``B``, and so forth, resulting in ``n`` returned objects to Python.
For example, computing the eigenvalues of a matrix is done by


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy, pytave
        A = numpy.random.random([2,2])
        e = pytave.feval(1, "eig", A)
        print 'Eigenvalues:', e

The eigenvalues *and* eigenvectors of a generalized eigenvalue
problem :math:`A v = \lambda B v` is computed by
obtain both the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors, we do


.. code-block:: python

        A = numpy.random.random([2,2])
        B = numpy.random.random([2,2])
        e, v = pytave.feval(2, "eig", A, B)
        print 'Eigenvalues:', e
        print 'Eigenvectors:', v

Note that we here have two input arguments, ``A`` and ``B``, and two output arguments, ``e`` and ``v`` (and because of the latter the first argument to
``feval`` is ``2``).

We could equally well solved these eigenvalue problems directly in
``numpy`` without any need for Octave, but the next example shows
how to take advantage of a package with many MATLAB/Octave files
offering functionality that is not available in Python.

Calling the MATLAB/Octave software
----------------------------------

The following scientific application involves the coupling of our
FEniCS flow solver with a MATLAB/Octave toolbox for solving
optimization problems based on Kriging and the surrogate managment
method.  Our task is to minimize the fluid velocity in a certain
region by placing a porous media within the domain. We can choose the
size, placement and permability of the porous media, but are not
allowed to affect the pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet
much. Figures :ref:`fext:ex3:fig1` and :ref:`fext:ex3:fig2` show the flow
velocity with two different placements of two different porous media.


.. _fext:ex3:fig1:

.. figure:: fig-fenics-mixed/opt_flow.png
   :width: 500

   Velocity problem around a porous media with :math:`K_0=1000, x_0 = 0.4, c=0.1`



.. _fext:ex3:fig2:

.. figure:: fig-fenics-mixed/opt_flow2.png
   :width: 500

   Velocity problem around a porous media with near optimal values: :math:`K_0=564, x_0 = 0.92, c=0.10`


For this particular application we assume that the Reynolds number is
low such that the flow can be modeled by the Stokes problem.
Furthermore, the additional resistance caused by the porous medium is
modeled by a positive lower order term :math:`K u` resulting in the
Brinkman model.  The equations then reads


.. math::
        
        -\Delta u + K u - \nabla p = 0,\quad
        \mbox{ in }\Omega 
        



.. math::
          
        \nabla \cdot  u = 0,\quad
        \mbox{ in } \Omega 
        



.. math::
          
         u = (0,0),\quad
        \mbox{ on } y=0,1 
        



.. math::
          
        u = (y(1-y),0),\quad
        \mbox{ on } x=0 
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + p n  =  0,\quad
        \mbox{ on } x=1
        

with


.. math::
        
        K = K_0 \mbox{ if } |x - x_0 | \leq  c,\ | y - 0.5 | \leq c,
        

while :math:`K=0` outside this rectangular region.

When :math:`K=0` we have viscous Stokes flow while inside the porous medium,
:math:`K=K_0`, and the :math:`K u` term in the equation dominates over the viscous
term :math:`\Delta u`.

The goal functional that we seek to minimize is

.. math::
        
        J(K_0, x_0, c) = u_x|_{(x=1,y=0.5)} + \int_\Omega (\nabla p)^2 \, dx
        

Here, :math:`u` and :math:`p` are functions of :math:`K_0`, :math:`x_0`, and :math:`c`, and
:math:`u_x` is the :math:`x` component of :math:`u`.

The MATLAB/Octave code for the surrogate management and Kriging is
based on `Dace <http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~hbn/dace/>`_, but has been
extended by Alison Marsden et. al. [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_
to implement surrogate management.
This algorithm
consists of four main steps 1) search, 2) poll, 3) refine and 4) run
simulations, with a flow chart appearing in Figure :ref:`fext:ex3:fig3`.
The two first steps find new sample points :math:`K_0`,
:math:`x_0`, and :math:`c`, while refine increases the resolution in the
parameter space, and finally the fourth step runs simulations with the new
sample points.

   *The flow chart of the surrogate managment method*


The main algorithm is implemented in Python and listed below.
It calls three key Python functions: ``search``, ``poll``, and ``refine``,
which make calls to the MATLAB/Octave package.


.. code-block:: python

        # main loop
        while nit <= max_nit and refine_ok and not converged:
           # search step
           if cost_improve:
               Ai_new = search(Aall, Jall, curr_bestA, theta,
                               upb, lob, N, amin, amax, spc, delta)
               prev_it = "search"
               Ai_new = coarsen(Ai_new)
           else:
               # poll step
               if prev_it == "search":
        	   Ai_new = poll(Aall, Jall, curr_bestA, N,
                                 delta, spc, amin, amax)
        	   prev_it = "poll"
               # refine if previous poll did not lead to cost improvement
               if prev_it == "poll":
        	   refine_ok, delta, spc = refine(delta, deltamin, spc)
                   if refine_ok:
        	       Ai_new = search(Aall, Jall, curr_bestA, theta,
                                       upb, lob, N, amin, amax, spc, delta)
        	       prev_it = "search"
                   else:
                       Ai_new = None
           nit += 1
        
           # run simulations on the new parameters
           if not Ai_new == None:
               Ai_new, J_new = run_simulations(Ai_new)
        
               # stack the new runs to the previous
               Jall = numpy.hstack((Jall, J_new))
               Aall = numpy.vstack((Aall, Ai_new))
        
               # monitor convergence (write to files)
               monitor(Aall, Jall, nit, curr_bestA, curr_bestJ,
                       delta, prev_it, improve, spc)
        
               # check convergence
               cost_improve, curr_bestA, curr_bestJ = check(
                   Ai_new, J_new, nit, curr_bestJ, curr_bestA)
           else:
               cost_improve = 0


The search and poll steps are both implemented in Python but are mainly wrappers around MATLAB/Octave functions.
The search step is implemented as follows:


.. code-block:: python

        def search(Aall, Jall, curr_bestA, theta, upb,
                   lob, N, amin, amax, spc, delta):
            """Search step."""
             # make sure that all points are unique
            (Am, Jm) = pytave.feval(2, "dsmerge", Aall, Jall)
        
            next_ptsall = []
            next_pts = None
            max_no_searches = 100
            no_searches = 0
            while next_pts == None and no_searches < max_no_searches:
        	next_ptsall, min_est, max_mse_pt = pytave.feval(
                    3, "krig_min_find_MADS_oct",
                    Am, Jm, curr_bestA, theta, upb, lob,
                    N, amin, amax, spc, delta)
        	next_pts = check_for_new_points(next_ptsall, Aall)
        	no_searches += 1
            return next_pts

Here, ``dsmerge`` and ``krig_min_find_MADS_kent`` are functions
available in the MATLAB/Octave
files ``dsmerge.m`` and ``krig_min_find_MADS_kent.m``. We need to notify
Octave about the directory (``SMF``) where these files can be found:


.. code-block:: python

        pytave.feval(0, "addpath", "SMF")


The FEniCS PDE solver
---------------------

The FEniCS solver first defines the inflow condition (class ``EssentialBC``),
the ``K`` coefficient in the PDEs, and the Dirichlet boundary:


.. code-block:: python

        class EssentialBC(Expression):
            def eval(self, v, x):
                if x[0] < DOLFIN_EPS:
                    y = x[1]
                    v[0] = y*(1-y);  v[1] = 0
                else:
                    v[0] = 0; v[1] = 0
        
            def value_shape(self):
                return (2,)
        
        class K(Expression):
            def __init__(self, K0, x0, c):
                self.K0, self.x0, self.c = K0, x0, c
        
            def eval(self, v, x):
                x0, K0, c = self.x0, self.K0, self.c
                if abs(x[0] - x0) <= c and abs(x[1] - 0.5) <= c:
                    v[0] = K0
                else:
                    v[0] = 1
        
        def dirichlet_boundary(x):
            return bool(x[0] < DOLFIN_EPS or x[1] < DOLFIN_EPS or \
                        x[1] > 1.0 - DOLFIN_EPS)

The core of the solver is the following class:


.. code-block:: python

        class FlowProblem2Optimize:
            def __init__(self, K0, x0, c, plot):
                self.K0, self.x0, self.c, self.plot = K0, x0, c, plot
        
            def run(self):
                K0, x0, c = self.K0, self.x0, self.c
        
                mesh = UnitSquareMesh(20, 20)
                V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "Lagrange", 2)
                Q = FunctionSpace(mesh, "Lagrange", 1)
                W = MixedFunctionSpace([V,Q])
                u, p = TrialFunctions(W)
                v, q = TestFunctions(W)
                k = K(K0, x0, c)
        
                u_inflow = EssentialBC()
                bc = DirichletBC(W.sub(0), u_inflow, dirichlet_boundary)
                f = Constant(0)
        
                a = inner(grad(u), grad(v))*dx + k*inner(u, v)*dx + \
                    div(u)*q*dx + div(v)*p*dx
                L = f*q*dx
        
                w = Function(W)
                solve(a == L, w, bc)
        
                u, p = w.split()
                u1, u2 = split(u)
        
                goal1 = assemble(inner(grad(p), grad(p))*dx)
                goal2 = u(1.0, 0.5)[0]*1000
                goal = goal1 + goal2
        
                if self.plot:
                    plot(u)
        
                key_variables = dict(K0=K0, x0=x0, c=c, goal1=goal1,
                                     goal2=goal2, goal=goal)
                print key_variables
                return goal1, goal2


Coupling FEniCS and the MATLAB/Octave software
----------------------------------------------

It now remains to do the coupling of the optimization algorithm that makes
use of MATLAB/Octave files and the FEniCS flow solver. The following
function performs the task:


.. code-block:: python

        def run_simulations(Ai):
            """Run a sequence of simulations with input parameters Ai."""
            import flow_problem
            plot = True
            if len(Ai.shape) == 1: # only one set of parameters
                J = numpy.zeros(1)
        	K0, x0, c = Ai
        	p = flow_problem.FlowProblem2Optimize(K0, x0, c, plot)
        	goal1, goal2 = p.run()
        	J[0] =  goal1 + goal2
            else: # several sets of parameters
                J = numpy.zeros(len(Ai))
                i = 0
        	for a in Ai:
        	    K0, x0, c = a
        	    p = flow_problem.FlowProblem2Optimize(K0, x0, c, plot)
        	    goal1, goal2 = p.run()
        	    J[i] = goal1 + goal2
        	    i = i+1
            return Ai, J


Installing Pytave
-----------------

Obviously, Pytave depends on Octave,
which can be somewhat challenging to install.
Prebuilt binaries are available
for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, SuSE, and FreeBSD), Mac OS X
(via MacPorts or Homebrew), and Windows (requires Cygwin).
On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu)
you are recommended to run these commands


.. code-block:: python

        # Install Octave
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libtool automake libboost-python-dev libopenmpi-dev
        sudo apt-get install octave  octave3.2-headers
        
        # Install Pytave
        bzr branch lp:pytave
        cd pytave
        bzr revert -r 51
        autoreconf --install
        ./configure
        sudo python setup.py install

Pytave has not yet been officially released, but it is quite stable
and has a rather complete interface to Octave. Unfortunately, the
latest changeset has a bug and that is why we need to revert
to a previous revision (``bzr revert -r 51``).

There are at least two Python modules that interface MATLAB:
`pymat2 <http://code.google.com/p/pymat2/>`_ and
`pymatlab <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymatlab>`_, but the authors do
not have MATLAB installed and were unable to test these packages.
