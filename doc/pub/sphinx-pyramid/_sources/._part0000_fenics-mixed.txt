Introduction
============

FEniCS is an easy-to-use tool for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) and enables very flexible specifications of PDE
problems.  However, many scientific problems require (much) more than
solving PDEs, and in those cases a FEniCS solver must be coupled to
other types of software.  This is usually easy and convenient if the
FEniCS solver is coded in Python and the other software is either
written in Python or easily accessible from Python.

Coupling of FEniCS solvers in Python with MATLAB, Fortran, C, or C++
codes is possible, and in principle straightforward, but there might
be a lot of technical details in practice. Many potential FEniCS users
already have substantial pieces of software in other more traditional
scientific computing languages, and the new solvers they write in FEniCS
may need to communicate with this existing and well-tested software.
Unfortunately, the world of gluing computer code in very different
languages with the aid of tools like F2PY, SWIG, Cython, and Instant
is seldom the focal point of a computational scientist.
We have therefore written this document to provide some examples and
associated detailed explanations on how the mentioned tools can be used to
combine FEniCS solvers in Python with other code written in MATLAB,
Fortran, C, and C++. We believe that even if the examples are
short and limited in complexity, the couplings are technically
complicated and broad enough to cover a range of different situations
in the real world.

To illustrate the tools and techniques, we focus on four specific
case studies:

 1. *A flow problem with boundary conditions depending on a system of
    ODEs*. The ODE solver and the ODE system are implemented in
    Fortran, and we use F2PY to generate wrapper code such that
    the ODE solver is accessible from Python.

 2. *A flow optimization problem*. The goal here is to compute the
    optimal placement, permeability and size of a porous medium within
    a flow field such that certain flow properties are minimized in a
    given region.  A FEniCS flow solver is coupled to sophisticated
    MATLAB/Octave code for steps in the optimization process (kriging
    and surrogate modeling).

 3. *DOLFIN library-level programming in C++*.  A new C++ utility,
    based on DOLFIN, for fast repeated evaluations of finite element
    functions on parallel computers is developed. We glue C++ code,
    DOLFIN, and Python with the aid of the FEniCS JIT compiler
    Instant.

 4. *A parabolic FEniCS solver in Python coupled to a C++ ODE solver at
    each node*.  In this example we illustrate F2PY, SWIG, and Cython
    as alternative ways for coupling C++ and Python codes.

This tutorial is meant for FEniCS users. For introductions to FEniCS,
see the gentle tutorial [Ref01]_, the paper
[Ref02]_, or the more comprehensive book about the FEniCS
project [Ref03]_.

The present tutorial is found on GitHub:
`<https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed>`_. The following command
downloads all the files:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> git clone https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed.git

The source code for the examples are located in the
subdirectory `doc/src/src-fenics-mixed <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed>`_.
The code examples are tested with FEniCS version 1.2.
