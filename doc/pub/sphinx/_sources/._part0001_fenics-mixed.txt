FEniCS solver with boundary conditions in FORTRAN
=================================================

FORTRAN programs are usually easy to interface in Python
by using the wrapper code
generator `F2PY <http://www.scipy.org/f2py>`_.
F2PY supports FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90, and even C (and thereby C++,
see the section :ref:`fext:pdeode:cpp`). It is our experience
that F2PY is much more straightforward to use than
the other tools we describe for interfacing Python with compiled languages.
F2PY is therefore a natural starting point for our examples.

The present worked example involves solving the Navier-Stokes equations by
a FEniCS solver, but calling up a FORTRAN 77 code for modeling the
boundary conditions.
The physical problem concerns blood flow in a cerebral aneurysm. An
aneurysm is a balloon-shaped deformation of a cerebral artery, see
Figure :ref:`fext:ex2:fig1`.  Some aneurysms rupture and cause stroke, while
other remain stable for long periods of time, and it is currently not
possible to determine the rupture risk in a patient-specific manner.
Computational studies have recently
demonstrated that fluid dynamics simulations can be used to discriminate ruptured from non-ruptured aneurysms [Ref04]_ [Ref05]_ [Ref06]_ [Ref07]_,
retrospectively, and have therefore demonstrated the potential of simulations to many clinicians.

To model blood flow we assume that blood is Newtonian and incompressible with a viscosity of 0.0035 Pa s and density similar to water.
The equations read


.. math::
        
        \rho (\frac{ \partial v}{\partial t} +
        (v \cdot \nabla) v) =
        -\nabla p + \mu \Delta u + f  
        \mbox{ in }\Omega 
        



.. math::
          
        \nabla \cdot v =  0    \mbox{ in } \Omega
        

Here, :math:`v` and :math:`p` are the unknown blood velocity and pressure,
respectively, while :math:`\mu` is the viscosity and :math:`\rho` the density.

Quite often the outlet boundary conditions are unknown. It is therefore
common to model the boundary conditions using differential equations
of lower dimension.  In our case, we assume that the pressure at the
inlet or outlet boundaries can be
modeled by a system of ODEs:


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial P_i}{\partial t} =
        f(P_i, v, p, \ldots)  \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega_o .
        

These ODEs are coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations through the
inlet or outlet boundary condition


.. math::
        
        \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + p n =  P_o 
        \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega_o
        


The FEniCS solver
-----------------

The Navier-Stokes solver is implemented in FEniCS as a
class ``NSSolver``.
The typical usage of the class goes as follows:


.. code-block:: python

           solver = NSSolver()
           solver.setIC()
           t = 0
           dt = 0.01
           T = 1.0
           P1, P2 = 0, 0
           while t < T:
               t += dt
               solver.advance_one_time_step((P1, P2), t)

The ``setIC()`` function sets the initial conditions. Futhermore,
``P1`` and ``P2`` are the pressures at the two outlets at time ``t``.
The implementation details of class ``NSSolver`` are not essential to
this document, so we just refer the reader to the relatively short
`NSSolver.py <https://bitbucket.org/simula_cbc/fenics-ext/src/default/src-fenics-mixed/ns/NSSolver.py>`_ file.

.. In the following, the most important knowledge about this file is

.. that ``u_`` and ``p_`` contains the most recently computed velocity and

.. pressure fields, respectively (the available solution).


.. The ``__init__`` function defines the various function spaces and variational forms:

.. @@@CODE src-fenics-mixed/ns/NSSolver.py fromto: class@ufile

.. The ``advance_one_timestep`` function implements the Chorin scheme:

.. @@@CODE src-fenics-mixed/ns/NSSolver.py fromto: advance_one_time_step@ufile


The FORTRAN code for modeling boundary conditions
-------------------------------------------------

The ``NSSolver`` class sets Dirichlet condition for the pressure on
inlet and outlet boundaries in terms of prescribed constants in a list
``P`` (one for each prescribed outlet or inlet). Our aim now is to use a
lower-dimensional flow model for computing the Dirichlet values in ``P``
based on physics and the current velocity and pressure fields. One
such model is formulated in terms of ODEs. For an outlet boundary, let
:math:`P` be the pressure at the boundary. Then the model for :math:`P` is


.. math::
        
        C \frac{\partial P} {\partial t} = Q - P / R_d,
        

where


.. math::
         Q = \int_{\partial \Omega_o} v \cdot n  ds 

is the volume flux throught the boundary :math:`\partial\Omega_o`
(easily computed in the FEniCS
solver). The parameters :math:`C` and :math:`R_d` must be prescribed along with
the initial value of :math:`P`.

The differential equation for :math:`P` can be discretized by a very simple
Forward Euler scheme. With :math:`i` denoting the time level corresponding
to small time steps :math:`\delta t` in the fluid solver time step :math:`\Delta t`,
we can write


.. math::
         P^{i+1} = P^i + \delta t (Q - P/R_d)/C,

for :math:`i=0,\ldots, N-1`, where :math:`\Delta t = N\delta t`, and then
the new pressure outlet condition is :math:`P=P^{N}` for the next time step.
:math:`P^0` is taken as :math:`P` at time :math:`t` (:math:`P` is the outlet pressure
value at time :math:`t+\Delta t`).

The computational model for :math:`P` is implemented in FORTRAN. (Our
specific model is a simple one; the problem setting is that another
research group is continuously developing such models, and their software
is in FORTRAN.) The solver in FORTRAN is implemented in a file
``PMODEL.f`` with the content


.. code-block:: fortran

              SUBROUTINE PMODEL(P, P_1, R_D, Q, C, N, T)
        C     Integrate P in N steps from 0 to T, given start value P_1
              INTEGER N
              REAL*8 P(0:N), P_1, R_D, Q, C, T
              REAL*8 DT
              INTEGER I
        Cf2py intent(in) P0, R, Q, C, N
        Cf2py intent(out) P
        
              DT = T/N
              P(0) = P_1
              DO I = 0, N-1
                P(i+1) = P(i) + DT*(Q - P(i)/R_D)/C
              END DO
              END SUBROUTINE PMODEL

Given ``P_1`` as the value of ``P`` at time ``t``, the subroutine computes
:math:`P` at all the ``N`` local time steps (of length ``DT``) up to time ``t+T``,
with ``P(N)`` as the final value at that time.  We shall call ``PMODEL``
at every time step in the flow solver and let ``T`` correspond to the
fluid solver time step :math:`\Delta t`.

The subroutine is plain FORTRAN 77 except for some special comment
lines starting with ``CF2PY``. These are needed because in
FORTRAN, subroutine arguments are both input and output,
but in Python one normally takes all input as arguments to a function
and *returns* all output arguments. This is technically not
possible in FORTRAN (or C or C++). With the ``CF2PY`` comment lines
we can help the F2PY translater to make the FORTRAN subroutine look
more "Pythonic" from the Python side. To this end, we need to specify
what arguments that are input and output. All arguments are
input by default, but here we still list them to have complete
specification of every argument in this function. The output
argument, to be returned to Python, *must* be specified, here ``P``.


Creating a shared library of the FORTRAN code that we can call from
Python as an ordinary module is easy:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> F2PY -c -m bcmodelf77 ../PMODEL.f

Here, ``-m bcmodelf77`` tells F2PY that the module name is
be ``bcmodelf77``, the ``-c`` instructs F2PY to compile and create
a shared library ``bcmodelf77.so``, and ``PMODEL.f`` is the name of
the FORTRAN file to analyze and compile. Our convention is to
compile F2PY modules in a subdirectory of the FORTRAN code,
which explains why the file here has name ``../PMODEL.f``.

A little test code can compare the FORTRAN ODE solver with a couple
of manual lines in Python:


.. code-block:: python

        import nose.tools as nt
        
        def test_bcmodelf77():
            import bcmodelf77
            C = 0.127
            R_d = 5.43
            N = 2
            P_1 = 16000
            Q = 1000
            T = 0.01
            P_ = bcmodelf77.pmodel(P_1, R_d, Q, C, N, T)
        
            # Manual formula:
            P1_ = P_1 + T/2*(Q - P_1/R_d)/C
            P1_ = P1_ + T/2*(Q - P1_/R_d)/C
            nt.assert_almost_equal(
                P_[-1], P1_, places=10, msg='F77: %g, manual coding: %s' %
                (P_[-1], P1_))
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            test_bcmodelf77()

Note that F2PY turns all upper case letters into lower case when
viewed from Python.  Also note that this test function is created as a
nose unit test. Running ``nosetests`` in that directory finds all
``test_*`` functions in all files and executes these functions.

Instead of calling the FORTRAN function directly with many parameters,
we wrap a class around the function such that the syntax of
each call to compute :math:`P` becomes simpler. The idea is to let
parameters that are constant through the fluid flow simulation
be attributes in the class so that it is sufficient to provide the varying
parameters in the call to ``PMODEL``. The Python code hopefully
explains this idea clearly:


.. code-block:: python

        class BCModel:
            def __init__(self, C, R_d, N, T):
                self.C, self.R, self.N, self.T = C, R_d, N, T
        
            def __call__(self, P, Q):
                P_ = bcmodelf77.pmodel(
                     P, self.R, Q, self.C, self.N, self.T)
                return P_

We can now set all constant parameters at once,


.. code-block:: python

        pmodel = BCModel(C=0.127, R_d=5.43, N=2, T=0.01)

and there after call the FORTRAN subroutine ``PMODEL`` by
``pmodel(P, Q)``, i.e., with only the arguments that change
from time step to time step in the fluid solver.

Coupling the Python FEniCS solver with the FORTRAN routine
----------------------------------------------------------

It remains to make the final glue between the FEniCS solver and
the FORTRAN subroutine. In the FEniCS solver, we import the
``BCModel`` class and make a list of such objects, with one element
for each outlet boundary where we want to use the ODE model. Then
we invoke a time loop where new :math:`u` and :math:`p` are computed, then
we compute the flux :math:`Q`, and finally we compute new outlet
pressures by calling up each ODE solver in turn.


.. code-block:: python

        import NSSolver
        from BCModel import BCModel
        
        solver = NSSolver.NSSolver()
        solver.setIC()
        t = 0
        dt = 0.01   # fluid solver time step
        T = 5.0     # end time of simulation
        
        C = 0.127
        R = 5.43
        N = 1000    # use N steps in the ODE solver in [t,t+dt]
        
        num_outlets = 2  # no out outflow boundaries
        
        # Create an ODE model for the pressure at each outlet boundary
        pmodels = [BCModel(C, R, N, dt) for i in range(0,num_outlets)]
        
        P_ = [16000, 100]   # start values for outlet pressures
        
        while t < T:
            t += dt
        
            # Compute u_ and p_ using known outlet pressures P_
            solver.advance_one_time_step(P_, t)
            # Compute the flux at outlet boundaries
            Q = solver.flux()
        
            # Advance outlet pressure boundary condition to the
            # next time step (for each outlet boundary)
            # (pmodels returns a vector of size N containg the 
            # the solution between [t, t+dt]. 
            # We take the last one with [-1])
            for i in range(0, num_outlets):
                P_[i] = pmodels[i](P_[i], Q[i])[-1]
