How to interface a C++/DOLFIN code from Python
==============================================

Although FEniCS can easily and flexibly be extended by Python code,
the need for speed in scientific computing occasionally makes
a demand to implement new finite element functionality in C++.
The present example shows how one can extend DOLFIN's finite
element functionality through a new piece of C++ code and call
this functionality from a Python FEniCS solver.

FEniCS finite element functions can be evaluated at an arbitrary
point in the mesh. In a parallel computing setting, however,
the evaluation point must be in the part of the mesh that belongs
to the current process and the searching for the element containing
the point is not optimally efficient. Therefore, one may want to
have a utility for fast evaluation of finite element functions
at prescribed points on parallel computers.
We can write a class ``Probe`` for this purpose. The constructor takes a spatial
point ``x`` and precomputes which element that
contains the point and other data useful for later
fast evaluation of functions at ``x``.
A member function ``eval(u)`` takes any ``Function`` object ``u`` and
stores its value(s) at the point ``x``. With ``get_values(i)`` we
can retrieve all values component ``i`` of the function computed in
previous calls to ``eval``.
For a scalar function there is only one component (``i=0``), but
the class supports vector and tensor functions too.

The name ``Probe`` reflects the use of such a class: we insert a
probe, as in a physical experiment, and measure the response
at that point through time. In FEniCS simulators it means that we
want to record the evolution in time of some field at a given spatial
point. For long time series there can be a lot of evaluations of
the field at this point, and class ``Probe`` will be much more
efficient than the standard FEniCS point evaluation of fields (which
performs a lot of searching to find the element containing the point).


The C++ class
-------------

Class ``Probe`` is a fairly short C++ code that makes use of various
DOLFIN C++ classes and programming conventions. The header file
reads


.. code-block:: c++

        #include <dolfin/function/FunctionSpace.h>
        #include <dolfin/function/Function.h>
        
        namespace dolfin
        {
          class Function;
          class FunctionSpace;
          template<typename T> class Array;
        
          class Probe
          {
          public:
            Probe(const Array<double>& point, const FunctionSpace& V);
            void eval(const Function& u);
            std::vector<double> get_values(std::size_t component);
        
            std::size_t num_components() {return value_size_loc;};
            std::size_t number_of_eval_calls() {return _probes[0].size();};
            std::vector<double> get_point();
            void erase(std::size_t i);
            void clear();
        
          private:
            std::vector<std::vector<double> > basis_matrix;
            std::vector<double> coefficients;
            double _x[3];
            boost::shared_ptr<const FiniteElement> _element;
            Cell* dolfin_cell;
            UFCCell* ufc_cell;
            std::size_t value_size_loc;
            std::vector<std::vector<double> > _probes;
          };
        }

The most important functionality for users
lies in the constructor and the ``eval`` and ``get_values`` functions, while the
rest of the class contains short convenience functions and data
structures for help with fast function evaluations.
Note that ``eval`` does not return any value, it just records the
value.

The reader may consult the corresponding `Probe.cpp <http://hplgit.github.io/fenics-mixed/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/probe/Probe/Probe.cpp>`_ file for all implementation
details. Obviously, this type of code requires familiarity with the
DOLFIN classes, but looking at the DOLFIN code itself is a good
starting point for learning about those classes, the associated
implementation conventions, and other programming tools that the
DOLFIN library makes use of.

Compiling and linking at the Python DOLFIN level
------------------------------------------------

The next, and often more technically challenging, step is to compile
the C++ code, link it to DOLFIN, and make it callable from a FEniCS
solver in Python.  Fortunately, this is not so difficult if we use the
FEniCS Just-in-time (JIT) compiler Instant, which is already the
compiler that DOLFIN applies when compiling variational forms. Instant
employs SWIG in its JIT compiling, and some knowledge of SWIG is
therefore required to understand how Instant works.  However, hardly
any SWIG knowledge is needed if we use the convenience function
``compile_extension_module`` found in the Python package ``dolfin``
package. This function is a high-level interface to Instant
functionality.

Basically, the ``compile_extension_module`` function
requires a declaration of our C++ code to be interfaced, a list
of ``.cpp`` source code files, and some information on where files
are found. Compilation and linking are then taken care of automatically.
The C++ code to be interfaced in this example
is contained in the ``Probe.h`` header file.
The call to the ``compile_extension_module`` function is then


.. code-block:: python

        from dolfin import *
        import numpy
        import os
        
        header_file = open("Probe/Probe.h", "r")
        code = header_file.read()
        header_file.close()
        probe_module = compile_extension_module(
            code=code, source_directory="Probe", sources=["Probe.cpp"],
            include_dirs=[".", os.path.abspath("Probe")])

We can now import ``probe_module`` in the forthcoming code and use it
for fast evaluations at some point ``x``:


.. code-block:: python

        mesh = UnitCubeMesh(10, 10, 10)
        V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', 1)
        
        x = numpy.array((0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
        probe = probe_module.Probe(x, V)
        
        u0 = interpolate(Expression('x[0]'), V)
        # Fast evaluation of U0 at x:
        probe.eval(u0)
        print "The value at ", x, " is ", probe.get_probe(0)

To summarize, with ``compile_extension_module`` the compilation and
linking of C++ and DOLFIN code to make accessible in Python is a matter
of one function call.

Compiling and linking at the Instant level
------------------------------------------

We shall now go into details how the steps above would be done by
using basic Instant only, as this explains how to use Instant for
interfacing C++ code in general.  Instant provides the ``build_module``
function for building a Python module out of the C++ code:


.. code-block:: python

        compiled_module = instant.build_module(
            code=code,
            source_directory=source_dir,
            additional_declarations=additional_decl,
            system_headers=system_headers,
            include_dirs=include_dirs,
            swigargs=swigargs,
            sources=sources,
            cmake_packages=cmake_packages)

Here,

 * ``code`` is the C++ code that is to be wrapped,

 * ``source_directory`` is the directory where the C++ ``.cpp`` files are found,

 * ``additional_declarations`` are additional declaration needed to
    make SWIG behave properly,

 * ``system_headers`` is a list of the additional header files needed
   for compilation,

 * ``include_dirs`` is a list of
   additional include directories required for compilation,

 * ``swigargs`` is the arguments that shall be passed to SWIG on the
   command line,

 * ``sources`` is
   a list of C++ files that shall be compiled into the Pyhton module, and

 * ``cmake_packages`` is a list of packages that the CMake compilation
   depend on.

The following code illustrates the setting of these variables:


.. code-block:: python

        system_headers = ['numpy/arrayobject.h',
                          'dolfin/function/Function.h',
                          'dolfin/function/FunctionSpace.h']
        swigargs = ['-c++', '-fcompact', '-O', '-I.', '-small']
        cmake_packages = ['DOLFIN']
        sources = ["Probe.cpp"]
        source_dir = "Probe"


The ``Probe`` class employs several DOLFIN classes. Hence, for this class
to work properly it is crucial that the JIT compiler and SWIG are told
how to relate to the DOLFIN classes. Instant provides the hook
``additional_declarations`` for providing additional declarations to
SWIG. Such declarations require knowledge of how to write
SWIG interface files. In the current example, the additional
declarations look like the following string:


.. code-block:: python

        additional_decl = """
        %init%{
        import_array();
        %}
        
        // Include global SWIG interface files:
        // Typemaps, shared_ptr declarations, exceptions, version
        %include <boost_shared_ptr.i>
        
        // Global typemaps and forward declarations
        %include "dolfin/swig/typemaps/includes.i"
        %include "dolfin/swig/forwarddeclarations.i"
        
        // Global exceptions
        %include <exception.i>
        
        // Local shared_ptr declarations
        %shared_ptr(dolfin::Function)
        %shared_ptr(dolfin::FunctionSpace)
        
        // %import types from submodule function of SWIG module function
        %import(module="dolfin.cpp.function") "dolfin/function/Function.h"
        %import(module="dolfin.cpp.function") "dolfin/function/FunctionSpace.h"
        
        %feature("autodoc", "1");
        """


The ``init`` part containing ``import_array`` is always needed when NumPy
arrays are involved.  Thereafter, we include various SWIG interface
files (ending in ``.i``) that we need in DOLFIN-related code. We also
need shared pointers for ``dolfin::Function`` and
``dolfin::FunctionSpace``. In addition we need header files for
``Function`` and ``FunctionSpace`` classes in DOLFIN. Note that the
``import`` and ``include`` statements in SWIG may seem similar, but that
whereas ``include`` makes SWIG generate wrappers for the code included,
the ``import`` directive simply provides SWIG with the necessary type
information.

We refer to the complete file `instant_test_probe.py <http://hplgit.github.io/fenics-mixed/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/probe/instant_test_probe.py>`_ for how all of the
information about is put together and executed in order to build the
extension module using plain Instant functionality.
