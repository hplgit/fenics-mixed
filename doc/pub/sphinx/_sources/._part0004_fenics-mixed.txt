FEniCS solver coupled with ODE solver in C++
============================================

In this final example we will consider a solver for a reaction-diffusion
equation described by a parabolic PDE coupled to a set of ODEs. The
equation can be written as


.. math::
        
        u_t &= \Delta u + f(u, s),
        & \forall x \in\Omega,\ t>0, \\ 
        s_t &= g(u, s),
        & \forall x \in \Omega,\ t>0.
        

Here, :math:`u` is a scalar function, subscript :math:`t` means differentiation with
respect to time, :math:`s` is a scalar field (governed pointwise by an ODE),
and :math:`\Delta u` is a Laplace term.
The problem is usually solved using a first order operator splitting scheme,
where we at a time level first solve the PDE with :math:`f` evaluated at
the previous time level, and thereafter we update the ODEs using
the most recent value of :math:`u`. More precisely,


.. math::
        
        u^n &= u^{n-1} + \Delta t (\Delta u^n + f(u^{n-1}, s^{n-1})),  \\ 
        s^n &= s^{n-1} + \Delta t g(u^n, s^{n-1}) ,
        

The superscript :math:`n` denotes the time level, and :math:`\Delta t` is the time step.

The solver for the parabolic problem is implemented in FEniCS, while
the ODE solver is implemented in a homemade C++ code. We will glue
these two different solvers together using Python. The C++ code consists
basically of the class ``ODEFieldSolver`` declared in a file
`ODEFieldSolver.h <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/ODEFieldSolver.h>`_:


.. code-block:: c++

        class ODEFieldSolver {
          int n;                // no of points (or regions)
          double* s;            // discrete values of unknown s)
          double* s_1;          // s at the previous time level
          double* u;            // discrete values of external field u
          double dt;            // time step size
        
          public:
          ODEFieldSolver();
         ~ODEFieldSolver();
          void redim(int n);    // allocate data structures
          int size();           // return the no of points/regions
          virtual double g(double s, double u);
          void set_dt(double dt);
          void set_IC(int n, double* in_array);
          void set_u (int n, double* in_array);
          void set_IC(double const_value);
          void set_u (double const_value);
          void advance_one_timestep();
        };

The ``set_IC`` functions set the initial condition of the ODE system, and
``set_u`` provides the :math:`u` field (the "environment") to the ODE system.
Note that there are two versions of ``set_IC`` and ``set_u``: one for
a constant value one for spatial variations. We refer to
the `ODEFieldSolver.cpp <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/ODEFieldSolver.cpp>`_
file for implementational details.

The mathematics behind the shown class is to have :math:`n` regional or pointwise
values of :math:`u` and :math:`s`, and then solve :math:`s_t = g(s,u)` in each region
or at each point. In the present case we will solve for :math:`s` at
the nodes in the finite element mesh used to compute :math:`u`.
The :math:`s` and :math:`u` functions are in the C++ code represented by
plain C arrays holding nodal values. The usage of the C++ code typically
goes like this:


.. code-block:: c++

        ODEFieldSolver solver = ODEFieldSolver();
        solver.redim(n);               // allocate data
        solver.set_dt(dt);             // set time step
        solver.set_IC(n, s0);          // set initial conditions
        t = 0
        while (t <= T) {
            solver.set_u(n, u);        // give access to PDE solution
            solver.advance_one_timestep();
            // plot solver.s
        }

A subclass must be written to specify the desired ``g`` function.

We need to wrap the C++ class in Python such that
the FEniCS Python solver can call the C++ code.
We would then need to transfer the computed
:math:`s` back to Python. To this end, we add a member function ``get_s``
to the class so that we can fill some array on the user's side with
the most recently computed ``s`` values:


.. code-block:: c++

        class ODEFieldSolver {
          ...
          void get_s  (int& n, double* out_array);
        };


Wrapping with F2PY
------------------

The easiest way to interface FORTRAN, C, and C++ code is to use F2PY.
Although F2PY was made for interfacing FORTRAN and most of the documentation
is written with FORTRAN codes in mind, it is convenient to interface
C and C++ too. Or more precisely, F2PY can interface a pure C API, not
C++ classes. The idea is then to construct a set of C functions on top
of the C++ classes for accessing high-level operations using the those classes.
The example involving class ``ODEFieldSolver`` will illustrate the elements
in this technique.

C API to C++ code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to decide on the C API. The exposed functions in
Python must do essentially the same as the main program. A possible
set of functions is

  * ``set_ic_and_dt(int n, double* s0, double dt)`` for initializing
    the class object and setting the initial conditions
    and the time step. Also a variant ``set_const_ic_and_dt`` for
    constant initial condition ``s0`` is handy.

  * ``set_u(int n, double* u)`` for assigning the ``u`` function to the class.

  * ``advance_one_timestep()`` for computing the solution at a time step.

  * ``get_s(int n, double* s)`` for getting access to the computed array ``s``
    in the ``ODEFieldSolver`` class.

These functions must make use of a global variable holding a
``ODEFieldSolver`` object and interact with this object as appropriate.
The `complete code of the C API <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/f2py-cpp/capi2cpp.cpp>`_ then becomes


.. code-block:: c++

        #include "ODEFieldSolver.h"
        
        ODEFieldSolver solver = ODEFieldSolver();
        
        extern "C" {
        
        void set_ic_and_dt(int n, double* s0, double dt)
        {
          solver.redim(n);
          solver.set_dt(dt);
          solver.set_IC(n, s0);
        }
        
        void set_const_ic_and_dt(int n, double s0, double dt)
        {
          solver.redim(n);
          solver.set_dt(dt);
          solver.set_const_IC(s0);
        }
        
        void set_u(int n, double* u)
        {
          solver.set_u(n, u);
        }
        
        void advance_one_timestep()
        {
          solver.advance_one_timestep();
        }
        
        void get_s(int n, double* s)
        {
          solver.get_s(n, s);
        }
        
        }


Writing corresponding FORTRAN signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nice thing about F2PY is that it can automatically make a Python
interface to this C code, where NumPy arrays can be passed to the
functions taking plain C arrays as arguments. For this to work, F2PY
needs a specification of all the C functions in terms of FORTRAN 90
module syntax. However, F2PY can generate this module for us if we
specify the function signatures in plain FORTRAN 77. This is done as
follows:


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine set_ic_and_dt(n, s0, dt)
        Cf2py intent(c) set_ic_and_dt
              integer n
              real*8 s0(0:n-1), dt
        Cf2py intent(c) n, s0, dt
              return
              end
        
              subroutine set_const_ic_and_dt(n, s0, dt)
        Cf2py intent(c) set_const_ic_and_dt
              integer n
              real*8 s0, dt
        Cf2py intent(c) n, s0, dt
              return
              end
        
              subroutine set_u(n, u)
        Cf2py intent(c) set_u
              integer n
              real*8 u(0:n-1)
        Cf2py intent(c) n, u
              return
              end
        
              subroutine advance_one_timestep()
        Cf2py intent(c) advance_one_timestep
              return
              end
        
              subroutine get_s(n, s)
        Cf2py intent(c) get_s
              integer n
        Cf2py intent(c) n
              real*8 s(0:n-1)
        Cf2py intent(c, in, out) s
              return
              end


For each C function we

  * write the corresponding FORTRAN subroutine or function header,

  * insert an F2PY-specific comment (``CF2PY``) that tells that the
    function is in C: ``intent(c)``,

  * specify that all variables are in C: ``intent(c)`` (FORTRAN treats
    all arguments as pointers, so the specification of C variables is
    strictly needed only for non-pointers),

  * specify if we want the Python interface to return one or more output
    arguments.

Regarding the last point, we specify ``s`` in ``get_s`` as ``intent(c,in,out)``,
meaning that we in Python can call this function as ``s = get_s(s)``.
The ``s`` argument is needed for the function to avoid
reallocating the returned array every time the function is call. Instead
we reuse the storage provied in the ``s`` array.

If the FORTRAN 77 signatures are in a file ``signatures_capi2cpp.f`` we
can get F2PY to generate a FORTRAN 90 module in a file ``ODEFieldSolvercpp.pyf``
by the command


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> F2PY -m ODEFieldSolvercpp -h ODEFieldSolvercpp.pyf \ 
                  --overwrite-signature signatures_capi2cpp.f

The ``-m`` option specifies the name of the extension module that contains
the Python interfaces to the C API.

The module typically looks like

.. code-block:: fortran

        !    -*- f90 -*-
        ! Note: the context of this file is case sensitive.
        
        python module ODEFieldSolvercpp ! in
            interface  ! in :ODEFieldSolvercpp
                subroutine set_ic_and_dt(n,s0,dt)
                    intent(c) set_ic_and_dt
                    integer, optional,intent(c),check(len(s0)>=n),depend(s0) :: n=len(s0)
                    real*8 dimension(n),intent(c) :: s0
                    real*8 intent(c) :: dt
                end subroutine set_ic_and_dt
                subroutine set_const_ic_and_dt(n,s0,dt)
                    intent(c) set_const_ic_and_dt
                    integer intent(c) :: n
                    real*8 intent(c) :: s0
                    real*8 intent(c) :: dt
                end subroutine set_const_ic_and_dt
                subroutine set_u(n,u)
                    intent(c) set_u
                    integer, optional,intent(c),check(len(u)>=n),depend(u) :: n=len(u)
                    real*8 dimension(n),intent(c) :: u
                end subroutine set_u
                subroutine advance_one_timestep ! in :ODEFieldSolvercpp:signatures_capi2cpp.f
                    intent(c) advance_one_timestep
                end subroutine advance_one_timestep
                subroutine get_s(n,s)
                    intent(c) get_s
                    integer, optional,intent(c),check(len(s)>=n),depend(s) :: n=len(s)
                    real*8 dimension(n),intent(c,in,out) :: s
                end subroutine get_s
            end interface
        end python module ODEFieldSolvercpp
        
        ! This file was auto-generated with f2py (version:2).
        ! See http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2pye/

Those who are familiar with FORTRAN 90 modules can write such
code by hand instead of first writing FORTRAN 77 headers and letting
F2PY generate the module.

Building the extension module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the aid of the FORTRAN 90 specification of the C functions, F2PY
can compile and link the extension module by a command like


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> F2PY -c --fcompiler=gfortran -I.. --build-dir tmp1 \ 
                 -DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=1 \ 
                  ODEFieldSolvercpp.pyf ../ODEFieldSolver.cpp capi2cpp.cpp

The ``-DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=1`` option is handy for letting F2PY
notify us if arrays are copied when transferred from Python to C,
as we want to avoid time-consuming copies. The C++ class is assumed
to be in the parent directory (note ``-I..`` and the ``../`` prefix
in the filename). All the files generated
and built by F2PY will reside in the ``tmp1`` directory for later
inspection if run into build problems.

The result of the above compile command is a C/C++ extension module
in the file ``ODEFieldSolvercpp.so``. The module can be loaded
into Python and examined for content:


        >>> import ODEFieldSolvercpp
        >>> dir(ODEFieldSolvercpp)
        ['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', '__version__',
         'advance_one_timestep', 'get_s', 'set_const_ic_and_dt',
         'set_ic_and_dt', 'set_u']
        >>> print ODEFieldSolvercpp.__doc__
        This module 'ODEFieldSolvercpp' is auto-generated with F2PY (version:2).
        Functions:
          set_ic_and_dt(s0,dt,n=len(s0))
          set_const_ic_and_dt(n,s0,dt)
          set_u(u,n=len(u))
          advance_one_timestep()
          s = get_s(s,n=len(s))

A word of caution is required for newcomers to F2PY: it is extremely
important to *study the doc strings* of the various functions before
trying to call them from Python. The reason is that F2PY drops
unnecessary arguments, such as array lengths (since these are
contained in NumPy array objects), and all output arguments are
returned and removed from the subroutine's argument list.
The function arguments and return values are therefore different
in Python and C!
For example, the ``set_ic_and_dt`` function only needs ``s0`` transferred
from Python since ``n`` can be deduced from the F2PY-generated
interface. The signature of this function, as seen from Python,
is then


        >>> print ODEFieldSolvercpp.set_ic_and_dt.__doc__
        set_ic_and_dt - Function signature:
          set_ic_and_dt(s0,dt,[n])
        Required arguments:
          s0 : input rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n)
          dt : input float
        Optional arguments:
          n := len(s0) input int

Furthermore, the ``get_s`` function has specified its ``s``
argument as input and output (``intent(c,in,out)``) and the
doc string shows the correct call syntax:


        >>> print ODEFieldSolvercpp.get_s.__doc__
        get_s - Function signature:
          s = get_s(s,[n])
        Required arguments:
          s : input rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n)
        Optional arguments:
          n := len(s) input int
        Return objects:
          s : rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n)


Main program in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python code for calling the C++ functions in the ``ODEFieldSolvercpp``
module can take the following form:


.. code-block:: python

        import ODEFieldSolvercpp as solver 
        import numpy
        
        s0 = numpy.array([0, 1, 4], float)  # ensure float elements!
        u = numpy.array([0, 1, 1], float)
        n = s0.size
        s = numpy.zeros(n)
        
        solver.set_ic_and_dt(s0, dt=0.1)
        for n in range(1, 8):
            solver.set_u(u)
            solver.advance_one_timestep()
            s = solver.get_s(s)
            print n, s


A pure C version of the C++ class
---------------------------------

It may be illustrative to also see a pure C code that implements
the same type of actions as the C++ class.
The class variables are here global variables in a library and
all the class functions are stand-alone C functions working with
these global variables. A bit more sophisticated implementation
would collect the global variables in a global struct instead, so
that the functions work with the struct.
The advantage of a pure C code is that F2PY can interface all parts
of this code directly without any need to make a C API to C++ code.
(Having said that, we should add that making a C API to C++ codes
is often a good exercise as it tends to emphasize faster computing with
arrays rather than with special (potentially small) C++ objects.
Python interfacing of C++ this way may lead to sound redesign of
the C++ code.)

The pure C implementation goes as follows:


.. code-block:: c

        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        
        /* global variables */
        double* s;
        double* s_1;
        double* u;
        double dt;
        int n;
        
        void redim(int n_)
        {
          n = n_;
          s =   malloc(sizeof(double)*n);
          s_1 = malloc(sizeof(double)*n);
          u =   malloc(sizeof(double)*n);
        }
        
        void deallocate()
        {
          free(s); free(s_1); free(u);
        }
        
        /* Note: do not mix upper and lower case letters as in set_IC_...
           This leads to undefined symbols when f2py compiles the code.
        */
        
        void set_ic_and_dt(int n_, double* s0, double dt_)
        {
          int i;
          redim(n_);
          dt = dt_;
          for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
            s_1[i] = s0[i];
          }
        }
        
        void set_const_ic_and_dt(int n_, double s0, double dt_)
        {
          int i;
          redim(n_);
          dt = dt;
          for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
            s_1[i] = s0;
          }
        }
        
        void set_u(int n_, double* u_)
        {
          int i;
          for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
            u[i] = u_[i];
          }
        }
        
        double g(double s_, double u_) {
          /* return s_*u_*(1 - s_); */
          return s_;
        }
        
        void advance_one_timestep()
        {
          /* Use the Forward Euler time integration for simplicity */
          int i;
          for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
            s[i] = s_1[i] + dt*g(s_1[i], u[i]);
            /* For debugging: */
            /* printf("i=%d, s_1=%g, dt=%g, g=%g, s=%g\n",
               i, s_1[i], dt, g(s_1[i], u[i]), s[i]); */
          }
          /* Update for next time step */
          for (i=0; i<n; i++) { s_1[i] = s[i]; }
        
        }
        
        void get_s(int n_, double* s_)
        {
          int i;
          for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
            s_[i] = s[i];
          }
        }


By writing the corresponding FORTRAN 77 signatures, F2PY can generate
a FORTRAN 90 module specification of the extension module, and this
code can be compiled as explained above.
We refer to the files in the `f2py-c <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/f2py-c>`_
directory for details.


Wrapping with SWIG
------------------

Next, we employ the tool `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_ to wrap the C++ class
directly and make it available as a Python class.
SWIG is also used in DOLFIN and Instant, as demonstrated
in the section :ref:`fext:dolfin:cpp`.
Useful references on SWIG in a FEniCS context
are [Ref02]_ [Ref08]_ [Ref09]_ [Ref10]_.

.. NOTE: when using mako (as we do) as preprocessor, % at the beginning

.. of lines becomes problematic. That is why we in the SWIG code

.. replace % by %% in the first column.


To use SWIG, you must first write an *interface file* (ending in ``.i``)
that tells SWIG about the parts of the C++ code you want to access
from Python. The next step is to run SWIG to generate (a lot of) wrapper
code in C. The final step is to compile the wrapper code and your C++ code
and link with required libraries.

A first attempt to write an interface for our ``ODEFieldSolver`` class
consists in listing just the class declaration:


.. code-block:: c++

        %module ODEFieldSolver
        %{
        #include <arrayobject.h>
        #include <sstream>
        #include "ODEFieldSolver.h"
        %}
        
        
        %init %{
        import_array();
        %}
        
        class ODEFieldSolver {
          int n;                // no of points (or regions)
          double* s;            // discrete values of unknown s)
          double* s_1;          // s at the previous time level
          double* u;            // discrete values of external field u
          double dt;            // time step size
        
          public:
          ODEFieldSolver();
         ~ODEFieldSolver();
          void redim(int n);    // allocate data structures
          int size();           // return the no of points/regions
          virtual double g(double s, double u);
          void set_dt(double dt);
          void set_IC(int n, double* in_array);
          void set_u (int n, double* in_array);
          void set_IC(double const_value);
          void set_u (double const_value);
          void advance_one_timestep();
        
          void get_s  (int& n, double* out_array);
        };


All SWIG commands start with ``%``. The ``%module`` command defines the
name of the module. Following this command comes a list of header files
needed by the module. The ``%init`` command includes code that should be
executed when the module is imported in Python. When using NumPy arrays
in C++ code we always need to call the ``import_array`` function to
initialize the NumPy package (removal of this statement will
result in a segmentation fault!).  The rest of the code defines the
interface that should be wrapped, that is; the declaration of the
class ``ODEFieldSolver``.

SWIG is meant to automate interfacing of C and C++ code, and there is
mainly only one thing that needs to be addressed manually: the
handling of pointers to arrays. Consider for instance the ``set_IC``
function. Here, ``in_array`` is a pointer to the first element of a
double precision array of length ``n``.  However, the fact that
``in_array`` is an array is not explicitly stated in C++, and therefore
SWIG simply by default handles the pointer as a plain pointer, and
this is not what we want. SWIG does, however, offer typemaps for
changing this default behavior.  With typemaps we can specify that the
pointer ``in_array`` is a NumPy array object (``PyObject``) when it comes
from Python, and we can extract the underlying data pointer
(``double*``) and communicate it to C.

To enable NumPy arrays to be passed to the functions ``set_IC`` and
``set_u`` we provide the following typemap.


.. code-block:: c++

        %typemap(in) (int n, double* array){
          if (!PyArray_Check($input)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, "Not a NumPy array");
            return NULL; ;
          }
          PyArrayObject* pyarray;
          pyarray = (PyArrayObject*)$input;
          if (!(PyArray_TYPE(pyarray) == NPY_DOUBLE)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, "Not a NumPy array of doubles");
            return NULL; ;
          }
          $1 = int(pyarray->dimensions[0]);
          $2 = (double*)pyarray->data;
        }


Typemap code often looks complicated, at least when viewed for the
first time. The logic is straightforward, though, once some basic
knowledge of the C API of Python and NumPy is acquired. The idea
with the typemap is to recognize a set of arguments in C/C++, here
``n`` and ``in_array``, and then execute some C/C++ code to transform
a Python object to the C/C++ arguments.
In the present example we want to map a NumPy array object
to an integer ``n`` (the array size) and a plain C array ``in_array``
(the array data). All Python objects, when viewed in C, are of type
``PyObject``. We can think of ``PyObject`` as a superclass for all the different
object types in Python. The special NumPy array object type is
``PyArrayObject``.

SWIG has some special variables prefixed with ``$``, which in the
present example are ``$input`` for the incoming NumPy array object, and
``$1`` and ``$2`` for the outgoing C/C++ arguments ``n`` and ``in_array``.
The first ``if`` statement checks that the incoming array is of right
type, and if not, a ``TypeError`` exception is raised.  The ``return
NULL`` statement is essential for this exception to work.  The next
step is to cast the ``PyObject`` pointer in ``$input`` to the correct
array object type, ``PyArrayObject``, because we need this object to
call C functionality in the NumPy object to extract the data and the
array size.  For safety reasons, we insert a test that the array data
are of type ``NPY_DOUBLE`` so that the array element types in Python and
C match.  Then we come to the final and most essential point:
extracting data from the NumPy array object and storing them in ``n``
(``$1``) and ``in_array`` (``$2``):


.. code-block:: c

          $1 = int(pyarray->dimensions[0]);
          $2 = (double*)pyarray->data;


Because we have overloaded the ``set_IC`` function, we also need to provide
SWIG with a ``typecheck`` to determine which of the C++ functions to use.
A suitable typecheck is:

.. code-block:: c++

        %typecheck(SWIG_TYPECHECK_DOUBLE_ARRAY) (int n, double* array) {
        $1 = PyArray_Check($input) ? 1 : 0;
        }


The function

.. code-block:: c++

        void get_s(int n, double *array);

should return NumPy arrays when called from Python as

.. code-block:: c++

        s = odesolver.get_s()

That is, we would like to be able to call this function from Python
without providing and input array, and instead get an output
array. This means that an array must be created before being passed to
C++ and then returned to Python. To accomplish this we hide the
function by calling it ``_get_s``. Then we extend the interface using
the ``%extend`` and ``%pythoncode`` directives with a Python function
``get_s``.  The Python function ``get_s`` allocate an array before passing
it to the hidden ``_get_s`` function and thereafter it
returns the array. The code is


.. code-block:: c++

        /* Wrap ODEFieldSolver::get_s in a Python function */
        %rename (_get_s) ODEFieldSolver::get_s;
        
        %extend ODEFieldSolver{
         %pythoncode%{
            def get_s(self):
              import numpy as np
              a = np.zeros(self.size())
              self._get_s(a)
              return a
         %}
        }


To summarize, the complete
SWIG interface file for wrapping the ``ODEFieldSolver`` class is
listed next.


.. code-block:: c++

        %module ODEFieldSolver
        %{
        #include <arrayobject.h>
        #include <sstream>
        #include "ODEFieldSolver.h"
        %}
        
        
        %init %{
        import_array();
        %}
        
        %typecheck(SWIG_TYPECHECK_DOUBLE_ARRAY) (int n, double* array) {
        $1 = PyArray_Check($input) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        %typemap(in) (int n, double* array){
          if (!PyArray_Check($input)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, "Not a NumPy array");
            return NULL; ;
          }
          PyArrayObject* pyarray;
          pyarray = (PyArrayObject*)$input;
          if (!(PyArray_TYPE(pyarray) == NPY_DOUBLE)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, "Not a NumPy array of doubles");
            return NULL; ;
          }
          $1 = int(pyarray->dimensions[0]);
          $2 = (double*)pyarray->data;
        }
        
        /* Wrap ODEFieldSolver::get_s in a Python function */
        %rename (_get_s) ODEFieldSolver::get_s;
        
        %extend ODEFieldSolver{
         %pythoncode%{
            def get_s(self):
              import numpy as np
              a = np.zeros(self.size())
              self._get_s(a)
              return a
         %}
        }
        
        %include std_string.i
        %include "ODEFieldSolver.h"


To make SWIG generate the wrapper code, we run


.. code-block:: console

        swig -python -c++  -I. -I.. ODEFieldSolver.i

SWIG supports many languages and we therefore specify what languages
we need wrapper code for by the ``-python`` and ``-c++`` flags. Further,
``-I`` is used to specify where SWIG should look for interface files
(with extension ``.i``).  The C++ class files are located in the parent
directory.  SWIG will from this command generate two files
``ODEFieldSolver.py`` and ``ODEFieldSolver_wrap.cxx``. The latter needs to
be compiled and linked with the ``ODEFieldSolver`` code to form a shared
library with name ``_ODEFieldSolver.so``. The ``ODEFieldSolver.py`` file
is the module to use from Python and this is nothing but a Python
class wrapper to ``_ODEFieldSolver.so`` module.  Building the shared
library is most conveniently done via a standard ``setup.py``
script. The following `setup.py <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/swig/setup.py>`_ file provides an
appropriate recipe for writing this kind of files:


.. code-block:: python

        import os, numpy
        from distutils.core import setup, Extension
        name = 'ODEFieldSolver'
        swig_cmd ='swig -python   -c++  -I.. -I.  %s.i' % name
        os.system(swig_cmd)
        sources = ['../%s.cpp' % name, '%s_wrap.cxx' % name]
        setup(name=name,
              ext_modules= [
                  Extension('_' + name,
                            sources,
                            include_dirs=['..',
                                          numpy.get_include() + "/numpy"])])


To create and install the extension module
locally in the current working directory (``.``),
we run


.. code-block:: bash

        python setup.py install --install-platlib=.

Now we can do ``import ODEFieldSolver`` in Python and access the
C++ class as a Python class.

The FEniCS solver for the parabolic PDE can be implemented as
a class:


.. code-block:: python

        class ParabolicSolver:
          def __init__(self, N, dt):
            """Set up PDE problem for NxN mesh and time step dt."""
            from dolfin import UnitSquareMesh, FunctionSpace, TrialFunction, \ 
                 TestFunction, Function, dx, dot, grad
        
            mesh = UnitSquareMesh(N,N)
            self.V = V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "Lagrange", 1)
        
            u = TrialFunction(V)
            v = TestFunction(V)
        
            a = u*v*dx + dt*dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
        
            self.a = a
            self.dt = dt
            self.mesh = mesh
            self.U = Function(V)
        
          def advance_one_timestep(self, f, u_1):
            """
            Solve the PDE for one time step.
            f: the source term in the PDE.
            u_1: solution at the previous time step.
            """
            from dolfin import TestFunction, dx, solve
        
            V, a, dt = self.V, self.a, self.dt  # strip off self prefix
            v = TestFunction(V)
            L = (u_1 + dt*f)*v*dx
        
            solve(self.a == L, self.U)
            return self.U


The following pseudo code illustrates how to work with this code and
the ODE solver:

.. code-block:: text


        for i in range(num_time_steps):   # time loop
            <compute f>
            <call ParabolicSolver's advance_one_time_step>
            <compute g>
            <call the ODE solver>

A `complete code <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/swig/test_coupled_solver.py>`_ goes as follows:

Wrapping with Cython
--------------------

Cython can also be used to wrap C/C++ code.
To this end we define the C++ class in a  ``.pyx`` `file <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/cython/ODEFieldSolver.pyx>`_:


.. code-block:: cython

        cimport numpy as cnp
        import numpy as np
        
        cdef extern from "ODEFieldSolver.h":
        
            cppclass ODEFieldSolver_ "ODEFieldSolver":
                ODEFieldSolver()
                void redim(int n)
                int size()
                double g(double s, double u)
                void set_dt(double dt)
                void set_IC(int n, double* array)
                void set_const_IC(double s0)
                void set_u (int n, double* array)
                void set_IC(double val)
                void set_u (double const_value)
                void advance_one_timestep()
                void get_s  (int n, double* array)


Here, we redefine the name to ``ODEFieldSolver_`` such that we may shadow the
underlying class with the following Python class:


.. code-block:: cython

        cdef class ODEFieldSolver:
            cdef ODEFieldSolver_  *wrapped
        
            def __init__(self):
                self.wrapped = new ODEFieldSolver_()
        
            def __dealloc__(self):
                if self.wrapped != NULL:
                    del self.wrapped


We have a pointer called ``wrapped`` to the underlying SWIG-generated
C interface to the C++ code.
Simple functions like e.g. ``redim`` are straightforward to wrap,


.. code-block:: cython

            def redim(self, n):
                self.wrapped.redim(n)


For the ``set_IC`` function we need to check that the input argument is a contiguous 1-dimensional numpy array
of type ``double``. This is spesified as ``cnp.ndarray[double, ndim=1, mode='c']``. Further, we check that
the length of the input array is the same as ``self.wrapped.size`` before we pass the input array to the
underlying C++ object.



.. code-block:: cython

            def set_IC(self, cnp.ndarray[double, ndim=1, mode='c'] array):
                if array.shape[0] != self.wrapped.size():
                    raise ValueError('incorrect dimension on array')
                self.wrapped.set_IC(array.shape[0], &array[0])


We allow the user to employ the ``get_s`` function both with and without an input
argument, refered to as ``out``. If the user does not supply any input,
i.e., ``if out is None`` then we create an array of appropriate type and size. Otherwise,
we check that ``out`` has the appropriate type and size before the array is passed to
the C++ object's ``get_s`` function. At the end, we simply return ``out``.


.. code-block:: cython

            def get_s(self,
                      cnp.ndarray[double, ndim=1, mode='c'] out=None):
                if out is None:
                    out = np.empty(self.wrapped.size(), dtype=np.double)
                elif out.shape[0] != self.wrapped.size():
                    raise ValueError('incorrect dimension on out')
                self.wrapped.get_s(out.shape[0], &out[0])
                return out


Finally, the module is built using a `setup.py <https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-mixed/blob/master/doc/src/src-fenics-mixed/ODEFieldSolver/cython/setup.py>`_ script for mixing Python, Cython, and C++ code:


.. code-block:: python
